# Readme

1. Why?
    - These ideas are what I believe can help grow the space, but I have too little time to finish 
    - I'd rather someone else make progress on it than let the idea sit idle in my spreadsheet without progress
1. How this works
    - Light touch AI advisory on the projects: Probably a couple mins a day on average, depending on my availability
    - Example: I'll point you to resources that can help you, or clarify some concepts. I am not likely to contribute that much code
    - Either party can exit anytime if they think the arrangement is unsuitable. No shame in choosing the best path.
    - In the spirit of open source, I'm ok with advising multiple groups working on the same topic. 
    - I'm usually stronger in algorithms, so the projects usually need engineers (all parts of the stack) and project managers
1. Conditions
    - The projects must be open sourced under the MIT License
    - You have a good attitude in learning and interacting with people. You know how to agree to disagree


# Open problems in web3 x Data / AI

1. Network analytics is a powerful tool in fraud detection in tradFi, but is not as readily available in web3. Can we have an entry level tool to make the space safer? 
    - typical use case: fraud wallet detection, fake volume / wash trading detection
    - see previous hackathon project [here](https://github.com/uncommon-insights/Linkalysis_fullstack) for more details
    - Validation: Arkham Intelligence provides network analytics; we want an open source basic version so that the space is safer
1. Some blockchain's transactions/ accounts tend to be less human readable, allowing bigger room for fraud. Are there techniques we can apply to mitigate this?
    - Guess: some form of machine translation or network patterns. Maybe the pattern's similarity to ETH can provide translation clues
1. Can we detect exploits early even if the attacker tries to be discreet?
1. Can we use data / AI techniques for more accurate economic simulations? eg test robustness of protocol
1. Can we have an entry level semantic search for blockchains, to increase ease of use and thus adoption?
1. Can we automate smart contract audits at a basic level?
1. How useful is anomaly detection on a global level for public goods? [notes](https://github.com/uncommon-insights/blockchain-network-analytics#tad)
1. How useful is core analytics (detection of groups of tightly interacting entities) [notes](https://github.com/uncommon-insights/blockchain-network-analytics#alphacore)
    - Shows that it is good at detecting CEX. How can this be useful?
1. In AI conferences such as NeurIPS, there are occasionally AI x blockchain workshops. See anything useful that might make a good project for the public?
1. can we extend ransomware detection on BTC (even in advance) to other chains?
    - [notes](https://github.com/uncommon-insights/blockchain-network-analytics#bcheist)
1. How can we utilize existing data sets for public goods?
    - [Chartalist notes](https://github.com/uncommon-insights/blockchain-network-analytics#chartalist)
        - multilayer / multichain analysis seem underanalyzed -- how can this be useful? 
1. New tech / libraries appear all the time -- can we have an entry level code assistant that rapidly adapts?
